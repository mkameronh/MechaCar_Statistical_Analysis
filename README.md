## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![Deliverable 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90940985/164297572-ef80636a-be05-42e1-882b-4eae961571b6.jpg)

### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Based on the results, I would say the following provided a non-random amount of variance:
- vehicle weight (0.0776)
- spoiler angle (0.3069)
- AWD (0.1852)

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
No, because the p-value is less than 0.05. According to our module 15.7.2, because the p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35e-11, which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, which means that the slope of our linear model is not zero.

### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
Based on the summary output, the value of r-squared is 0.71. That means that approximately 71% of all mpg predictions will be correct when using this linear model.
